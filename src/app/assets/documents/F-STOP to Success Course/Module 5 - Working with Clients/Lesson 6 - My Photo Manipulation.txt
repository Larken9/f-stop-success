Action Task 5-6

(PDF Provided and Needs Approval)

Introduction:

As we previously talked about, Photo Manipulation is a fantastic technique to use in support of helping clients see how things can be different.  When you can give your client the chance to create a different outcome, even a desired one, they are more apt to believe it’s possible.  

Main Teaching Points and Supporting Points:

In this Action Task, I am giving you the freedom to use the PhotoTherapy technique of Photo Manipulation any way you like.   This means you have the freedom to choose the image or photograph you want to work with, the freedom to choose a concern or trouble you want to work on, and the freedom to choose how you want to apply the technique to that specific concern.   In other words, you have creative license to use technique #9, Photo Manipulation in a way that best suits a change or desired outcome you have for yourself.

I want you to choose a concern or trouble you are currently experiencing in your own life.  One that up until this point you haven’t been able to fully change or alter.  The reason I want you to work with a personal concern or trouble is because when we work from a place of authenticity, we are more apt to benefit from the process itself.  

Review and Outcome:

So, go grab an image or a photograph that relates best to the concern or trouble you are facing, and choosing any form of manipulation you like, turn that image or photograph into something that feels better, stronger, and closer to your desired outcome.  

Once you have finished this activity, I want you to send me a copy of your Photo Manipulation and I will give you the green light to move onto Learning Lesson Seven.  

Next Steps:

I’ll meet you in the next Learning Lesson.
