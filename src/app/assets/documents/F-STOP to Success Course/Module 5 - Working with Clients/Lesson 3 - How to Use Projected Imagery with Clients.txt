Action Task 5-3

(PDF Provided and Needs Approval)

Introduction:

Welcome to Learning Lesson Three, Action Task 5-3.  This Action Task that will not only support your learning of the technique of projected imagery with clients, but it will also support your experiencing the benefits of projected imagery firsthand.  

If you have reached this stage and are ready to move forward with Action Task 5-3, it means that you have secured a projector that will enable you to project one of your own personal images or photographs to a life size format, and that you are ready to set up an online session with myself whereby we can walk through the process of projected imagery together.   

This is a necessary step in your learning process as it will give you a clear and solid foundation for what projected imagery is and how effective it can be with clients experiencing trauma, abuse, or loss.   During our session together we will explore the use of projected imagery versus regular imagery using one of your own photographs, as well as what questions and directives are best used. 

Setting Up Your Online Session:

To set up your online session, simply email me at kelly@pictureyourselfwell.com.  Once I have received your email, I will contact you to set up a mutually beneficial time to carry out Action Task 5-3.  

Review and Outcome:

Again, once you have completed Action Task 5-3, your online session and learning opportunity with myself, you will be given the green light to move forward onto Learning Lesson Four.

Next Steps:

I look forward to hearing from you and working through Action Task 5-3 together.   Once we have completed our walk through you will be able to move onto Learning Lesson Four.  Iâ€™ll see you there.
