Introduction:

The journey of self-improvement is constant.  It is an ongoing process of continual learning.  Learning that helps to identify your personal strengths and weakness, and how to work with them.   From careers to relationships, knowing your strengths is important for every aspect of your life.   

Main Teaching Points and Supporting Points:

As you have been learning, PhotoTherapy supports all concerns, and that means your concerns as well.  So continued work using photographs, films, and imagery of any kind can only benefit you in the long run.  Both personally and professionally.  

There will be many more instances where you will be faced with personal and professional obstacles and having a tool like PhotoTherapy in your back pocket to use whenever you need to will come in handy. 

Self-improvement means that you are being mindful of your own needs so that you are better equipped to support the needs of others.  This is especially important for those of us who are in the mental health field.  Our roles require us to be there for others day in and day out, and if we are not personally sound then we cannot be professional sound.

Review and Outcome:

The best therapists and mental health workers are those that continue to work on themselves.  Those who know the benefits of regularly checking in with themselves to see where they are in need of support … and then getting it!  And now that you have access to the most incredible visual tool ever, PhotoTherapy, you too can utilize its supportive benefits whenever you need it.
